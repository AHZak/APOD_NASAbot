This is a simple Telegram bot written in Python using Flask.  
It wraps NASA's APOD API, giving access to it's archive.  
No Python Telegram library is being used in this project so it's handy if you want to learn Telegram Bot API interactions and play with requests and responses! Why not :)  
Also a built-in file-based logging system will help you understand more out of what's happenig behind the scenes.
