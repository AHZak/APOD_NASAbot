## Astronomy Picture of the Day for Telegram

[![APOD Telegram Bot](https://badgen.net/badge/Telegram/Start%20using%20the%20bot/blue?icon=telegram)](https://t.me/APOD_NASAbot/)

This is a simple Telegram bot written with Python, and Flask, wrapping NASA's [APOD API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api), and giving access to their image archives via Telegram. No external Telegram library for Python is used in this project, so it is handy if you want to learn to use the Telegram Developer API.

The project also has a built-in file-based logging system which will help you better understand what is actually happening behind the scenes.

## Running the bot

> README will be updated with more instructions on how to run the bot locally.
