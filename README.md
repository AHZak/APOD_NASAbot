## APOD - A Telegram bot written with Python, and Flask

**Source code of [APOD Telegram bot](https://t.me/APOD_NASAbot/)**

This is a simple Telegram bot written with Python, and Flask. The bot wraps NASA's [APOD API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api), and gives access to their archives via Telegram. No external Telegram library for Python is being used in this project so it is handy if you want to learn to use the Telegram Developer API.

The project also has a built-in file-based logging system which will help you better understand what is actually happening behind the scenes.

> README will be updated with more instructions on how to run the bot locally.
